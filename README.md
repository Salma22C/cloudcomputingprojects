# ☁️ Cloud Computing Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cloud Computing Projects Portfolio** — a curated showcase of hands-on cloud engineering projects built using Amazon Web Services. These projects demonstrate practical experience in serverless architecture, AI/ML integration, infrastructure as code, cost optimization, and scalable deployments.
